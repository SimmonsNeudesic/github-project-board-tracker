## Usage

### Basic Usage

Export entire project to CSV (default):
```bash
python project_board_tracker.py --owner myorg --project 1 --format csv
```

Export filtered by milestone to Excel:
```bash
python project_board_tracker.py --owner myorg --project 137 --filter 'milestone:"Release 1.10.5.8" is:issue' --format excel --output report.xlsx
```

Export with PR approval data (PRs filtered from report but used for approval matching):
```bash
python project_board_tracker.py --owner myorg --project 137 --filter 'milestone:"Release 1.10.5.8"' --format excel --output report.xlsx
```

Export including PRs in the report:
```bash
python project_board_tracker.py --owner myorg --project 137 --filter 'milestone:"Release 1.10.5.8"' --include-pr --format excel --output report.xlsx
```

Export to Markdown:
```bash
python project_board_tracker.py --owner myorg --project 1 --format markdown --output report.md
```

### PR Approval Matching

üîó **New Feature!** The tracker now automatically fetches PR reviews and matches approvers to linked issues.

**How it works:**

1. When you run a query that includes PRs (without `is:issue` filter), the tracker fetches all PR reviews
2. PR approvers are automatically extracted from GitHub review data
3. PRs are matched to their linked issues using GitHub's `closingIssuesReferences`
4. Approval information flows from PRs to issues automatically
5. By default, PRs are **excluded from the report** but their approval data is preserved for issues

**Usage scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Issues only (no PR data)**
```bash
# Filter explicitly excludes PRs, so no PR approval data is available
python project_board_tracker.py --owner myorg --project 137 --filter 'milestone:"Release 1.10.5.8" is:issue' --format excel --output report.xlsx
```
- Report contains: Issues only
- Approval data: From project board fields only

**Scenario 2: Issues with PR approval data (recommended)**
```bash
# Filter includes PRs, but they're filtered from report output
python project_board_tracker.py --owner myorg --project 137 --filter 'milestone:"Release 1.10.5.8"' --format excel --output report.xlsx
```
- Report contains: Issues only
- Approval data: **Enriched with PR approver names**
- PRs are fetched for approval data but not included in report

**Scenario 3: Include PRs in report**
```bash
# Use --include-pr to show PRs as separate items
python project_board_tracker.py --owner myorg --project 137 --filter 'milestone:"Release 1.10.5.8"' --include-pr --format excel --output report.xlsx
```
- Report contains: Issues AND Pull Requests
- Approval data: Full PR approval information
- PRs appear as separate rows with Source = "Pull Request"

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic approval tracking from code reviews
- ‚úÖ No manual data entry needed for approvals
- ‚úÖ Accurate approver names from GitHub reviews
- ‚úÖ Flexible - use PRs for data enrichment or include them in reports

### Using Filters (Recommended)

The `--filter` option supports full GitHub search query syntax, allowing you to export only the issues you care about:

**Filter by milestone (exclude PRs):**
```bash
python project_board_tracker.py --owner neudesic --project 137 --filter 'milestone:"Release 1.11.0.0" -is:pr' --format excel --output release_report.xlsx
```

**Filter by state and label:**
```bash
python project_board_tracker.py --owner myorg --project 1 --filter 'state:open label:bug' --format csv --output open_bugs.csv
```

**Filter by assignee:**
```bash
python project_board_tracker.py --owner myorg --project 1 --filter 'assignee:john state:open' --format markdown --output johns_tasks.md
```

**Complex filters:**
```bash
python project_board_tracker.py --owner myorg --project 1 --filter 'milestone:"Sprint 5" label:feature state:closed' --format excel --output completed_features.xlsx
```

### Supported Filter Syntax

The filter supports all GitHub search query operators:
- `milestone:"Release 1.10.5.8"` - Filter by milestone name
- `state:open` or `state:closed` - Filter by issue state
- `label:bug` or `label:"needs review"` - Filter by labels
- `assignee:username` - Filter by assignee
- `author:username` - Filter by author
- `is:pr` or `is:issue` - Filter by type
- `-is:pr` - Exclude pull requests
- `-is:issue` - Exclude issues
- `created:>2024-01-01` - Filter by date
- Any combination of the above using spaces

For more information on GitHub search syntax, see: [GitHub Search Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests)

### AI-Powered Field Extraction

The tracker can intelligently extract missing Project board fields from issue bodies and comments using Azure OpenAI. This is useful when:
- Your Project board lacks custom fields for Business Need, Acceptance Criteria, etc.
- Issues contain rich content but it's not structured in Project board fields
- You want automated extraction without manually adding custom fields

**Setup:**

1. Deploy an Azure OpenAI resource with `gpt-4o-mini` or `gpt-4.1-mini`
2. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-4.1-mini/chat/completions?api-version=2025-01-01-preview"
   export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

**Usage:**

```bash
python project_board_tracker.py \
  --owner neudesic \
  --project 137 \
  --filter 'milestone:"Release 1.10.5.8" is:issue' \
  --format excel \
  --output report.xlsx \
  --extract-from-body
```

**What Gets Extracted:**
- Business Need - Why the issue matters
- Acceptance Criteria - Definition of done
- Test Case IDs - Test case references
- Test Evidence URL - Links to test results
- Design Artifacts URL - Links to design docs
- Risk - Risk level and description
- Release Version - Target release
- Change Log - Summary of changes

**Features:**
- üíæ **Smart Caching** - Extractions are cached in `.ai_cache/` to avoid re-processing
- üóÇÔ∏è **Per-Project Cache Separation** - Cache files are organized by owner/project (e.g., `.ai_cache/myorg_137_extractions.json`)
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Re-extraction** - Automatically re-extracts if issue is updated since last cache
- üè∑Ô∏è **Source Annotation** - AI-extracted fields are marked with `[AI-Extracted]`
- üí∞ **Cost-Effective** - Uses gpt-4o-mini (~$0.0005 per issue, ~$0.50 for 1000 issues)
- üö´ **No Cache Conflicts** - Multiple projects can be tracked without cache key collisions

**Example Output:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Business Need | Prevent security vulnerability from overly permissive CORS policy [AI-Extracted] |
| Risk | Medium: Overly permissive cross-domain policy allows malicious sites to exploit user sessions [AI-Extracted] |
| Change Log | Removed '*' from allowed CORS domains; configured allowed domains per service [AI-Extracted] |

**Note:** All missing fields are represented as "N/A" to clearly identify incomplete data.

## Custom Fields

The script automatically extracts custom fields from your GitHub project board. The script uses flexible field name matching that handles variations in naming:

- **Exact match**: Looks for exact field names first
- **Normalized match**: Handles spaces, underscores, hyphens, and case variations
  - "Issue ID", "Issue_ID", "issue-id", "issue id" are all recognized
  - "Business Need", "Business_Need", "business-need" are all recognized

If custom fields don't exist, the script attempts to extract information from:

- Issue body (for Business Need and Acceptance Criteria)
- Labels (for Priority - supports patterns like "priority:", "p0", "p1", "high", "medium", "low", "critical")
- Assignees (for Owner - uses first assignee if Owner field is not set)

All missing fields are represented as "N/A" to clearly identify incomplete data.

## Troubleshooting

**Error: GitHub token is required**
- Make sure you've set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable or use the `--token` flag

**Error: GraphQL errors**
- Verify your token has the correct permissions
- Check that the project number is correct
- Ensure you have access to the organization/project

**Excel export fails**
- Install openpyxl: `pip install openpyxl`

## Requirements
